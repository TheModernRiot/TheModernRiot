- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheModernRiot. I was a dog roomer for 10 years and took the confusing first steps of learning the *fun and very easy* world of c# and microsft related language such as LINQ, the .NET family, AZURE, ect.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to build software for small companies.
- 💞️ I'm here also to lurk and find projects to help build my coding knowleage.
- 📫 If you want to look at my current building stack, my stackshare is in my profile.
